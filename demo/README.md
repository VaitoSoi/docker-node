# Demos for Docker Node

## This is generated by AI
Yes, apologise for my laziness ;-; But dont worry, I wrote this README on my own :D

All these code are generated by Github Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4).

## Demos
Each file contain the demo of each coresponding component. I can't test the Swarm component yet because I can't setup one on my machine, sorry ;-;

And each file will have an error handling part, it is usually at the end of the file.
